Secure Password Generator
This simple tool creates strong, random passwords. It's designed to make passwords that are both secure and easy to read, by avoiding letters and numbers that look similar (like l and 1).

How to Use
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., password_generator.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Go to the folder where you saved the file.
Run the script with this command:
Bash
python password_generator.py
The script will then show you a new, secure password.

Example Password
@-gA(Pq_{C[_
(Each time you run it, you'll get a different password.)
